First of all you have to create virtual env and install required Python libs (I assume that you have already installed Python and pip)

### Example how to create virtual env (using builin venv lib) and install requirements

Run CMD and go to main app directory. Then run below commands:  
`python -m venv venv`  
`venv\Scripts\activate`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`venv\Scripts\activate`
